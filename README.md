# CCNA-200-301-Lab

As-salamu alaykum. Welcome to the CCNA-200-301-Lab repository! ðŸš€

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to providing hands-on labs and resources for individuals preparing for the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) exam (200-301). Whether you're a beginner looking to build foundational networking skills, you'll find a variety of practical exercises to enhance your understanding of networking concepts. This repository features labs created by three esteemed professionals: David Bombal, Jeremy, and Neil Anderson. While Jeremy's videos and lab files are accessible for free on YouTube, the full range of practice materials from David Bombal and Neil Anderson can be obtained by purchasing their respective courses on Udemy. In this repository, you can freely access lab files associated with Jeremy's content. I encourage users with the means to do so to support these instructors by purchasing their courses on Udemy. Our support enables them to continue creating high-quality educational content.
